# 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists

## Description
This repository contains C programs that implement doubly linked lists. Doubly linked lists are a type of linked list in which each node contains a data field and two pointers to the next and previous nodes in the sequence.

## Files
- **0-print_dlistint.c**: A function that prints all the elements of a doubly linked list.
- **1-dlistint_len.c**: A function that returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.
- **2-add_dnodeint.c**: A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
- **3-add_dnodeint_end.c**: A function that adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.
- **4-free_dlistint.c**: A function that frees a doubly linked list.
- **5-get_dnodeint.c**: A function that returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.
- **6-sum_dlistint.c**: A function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a doubly linked list.
- **7-insert_dnodeint.c**: A function that inserts a new node at a given position.
- **8-delete_dnodeint.c**: A function that deletes the node at index index of a doubly linked list.
